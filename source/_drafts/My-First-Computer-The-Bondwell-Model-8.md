I'm not exactly sure when I got my first computer, I think it must have been around 1987 or 1988, so I must have been about 11 years old. It was a hand me down from my father - he had gotten a new work computer, and no one ever asked for the old one back, I guess. Anyway, I don't think it was that old when I got it.

[PICTURE OF ME PLAYING]

The computer was a Bondwell model 8, which was not exactly a gaming computer, but of course, play games is what I primarily used it for. By that time, most of my friends had Commodore 64's, and in some cases Amigas or Ataris (although that might have been a little bit later), but I made do with my Bondwell. I used that computer up until sometime in the early nineties when I got a Mira AT, which was hade a 10 Mhz 80286 CPU and EGA graphics, and even a hard drive (a 20 MB MFM drive if I remember correctly)! That computer was upgraded in several steps and in the end it had a 386/40Mhz processor, VGA graphics, a Sound Blaster card and about 200MB of hard drive space (spread over several drives). It was replaced in 1997, when I spent a whopping 12 000 SEK on a brand new Pentium 166 Mhz computer and finally left the DOS era.

But back to the Bondwell. The Bondwell model 8 was released in 1985 and had rather impressive specs for a portable computer of the time:

- CMOS 80C88 CPU operating at 4.77Mhz
- 512 KB dynamic user RAM
- LCD
  - High-contrast backlit LCD display
  - 80 x 25 text display
  - 640 x 200 graphics display
- Real time clock
  - time-of-day clock and calendar
  - automatic end-of-month recognition
  - automatic leap-year compensation
  - battery backed
- Hinge with external view angle adjustment through a maximum of 180 degrees
- Built-in graphic interface
  - 640 x 200 pixels
  - high resolution multi-color display
- Built-in 3.5" microfloppy disk drive with 720KB formatted capacity
- Keyboard
  - 76 full-stroke keys
  - low profile keytops
  - 10 function keys
- Rechargeable battery powered with battery-low warning (LED flickers when battery runs low)

The spec list above is verbatim from the User's manual. Note that a battery backed real time clock is a feature that you need to point out.


TODO:

- Compare with the IBM AT
- Compare with other laptops of the time
- Link to the review
- Write a bit about the actual hardware (with pictures): Good keyboard, cool acid-lead batteries, 3.5" drive before it was common, 512KB memory was a lot.
- Battery replacement.
- CGA graphics
- Picture, outside and inside.
- Write a bit about the newly acquired one.
