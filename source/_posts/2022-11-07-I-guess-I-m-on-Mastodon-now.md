So, yeah, I also joined that elephant-network, Mastodon. You can find me at [mastodon.social/@nahojd](https://mastodon.social/@nahojd). Beacause, you know, I want to be where it happens.

I've come to realise that not everyone has the same experience of Twitter that I have, mostly beacuse I'm using the Flamingo client for Android, which means I have a strictly chronological flow, consisting only of accounts that I follow, and no ads. So I'm keeping my Twitter account for the forseable future, or until they cut 3rd party API access completely!
