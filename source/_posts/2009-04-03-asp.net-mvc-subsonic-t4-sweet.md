I’ve been fiddling around with [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) and [SubSonic](http://subsonicproject.com/) 3 for a while (as I mentioned in a previous post), and also been learning some cool stuff about [T4 Templating](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/T4TextTemplateTransformationToolkitCodeGenerationBestKeptVisualStudioSecret.aspx). Now [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/) has created a [very cool Visual Studio template](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/putting-the-ldquo-m-rdquo-back-in-mvc/) bringing all this together (be sure to watch the video). And it even includes single sign on capabilities with e.g. Google and OpenID! And yeah, lots of ajax with jQuery.

I tried using this yesterday, and apart from his template being a little bit broken it really works! I created a data driven MVC web application with my own custom database in like 30 minutes. And without any magic, unmaintainable code that you can’t fiddle with. It’s just plain MVC, with SubSonic domain objects.

So I started over with the [Dropit Labs](http://labs.dropit.se) site (which is actually only a static html page right now), using this. And after 2 more hours work I’m now only a little styling away from replacing the static version with a new state-of-the-art ASP.NET MVC version that will look almost exactly the same! I’m hoping to find the time to use my crazy css skills this weekend, and being able to release it next week.
