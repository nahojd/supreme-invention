Ever wished that you could extract the data from [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) and process it in some powerful application like say, Microsoft Excel? Well, now you can!

Excellent Analytics is a simple Excel plug-in that letâ€™s you import data from you analytics account straight into your spreadsheet. It has been developed as thesis work here at Dropit by our former intern Fredrik Johansson (great job!), and is available as open source at [excellentanalytics.com](http://excellentanalytics.com), or if you want the source code at [http://code.google.com/p/excellent-analytics/](http://code.google.com/p/excellent-analytics/).

It is also being released as a part of our Labs project at [http://labs.dropit.se](http://labs.dropit.se).
