When you're working in this line of business, developing web sites, that is, you're not that used to praise. Once a web site has been launched, most of what you hear is bugs and new feature requests. But once in a while we get the praise we deserve! :-) 

Today the Swedish magazine [internetworld](http://internetworld.idg.se/) published a [review of the public web sites for 6 of Sweden's largest unions](http://www.idg.se/17.108/2.1085/1.206384/sa-bra-ar-fackforbunden-pa-webben). The site I have been working on, unionen.se, got 9/10, and a splendid review, the title of which reads "[Good looking and smart in a modern suit](http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.206407/snyggt-och-smart-i-modern-kostym)". 

I worked on unionen.se pretty most of 2007 as a [Scrum master](http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/39-glossary-of-scrum-terms#1121) and systems architect. It was one of our first real [Scrum](http://www.scrumalliance.org/pages/what_is_scrum) projects here on Dropit, and I dare say one of the most successful ones so far. One the most important reasons for that was that we had a great [Product owner](http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/39-glossary-of-scrum-terms#1122) (Karin), but also that we were a very good and dedicated team (you know who you are!). Dropit was responsible for the whole delivery, so we worked both with the conceptual and graphical design as well as with the technical implementation. The site is based on [EPiServer](http://labs.dropit.se/blogs/admin/Pages/www.episerver.com) 4.62 and our internal framework Foundation. 

We had the privilege of having the whole team sitting together with the customer, which wasn't the standard way to do it for us back then. Since then we are advocating this more and more, since the collaboration with the customer really improved. It was also a technically challenging project, as we were heavily dependent on the SOA infrastructure being developed simultaneously, and we even had to work on New Year's Day to make the launch. But it really paid off, and it's extra fun for this to get recognized on idg.se! 

So once again, thanks to all the people that worked so hard to create unionen.se!
