## Commodore (8-bit)

The Commodore 64 was originally released in 1982, and my oldest one was manufactured

### Parts
### Peripherals

## Monitors
### Victor VGA monitor

Came with the Victor V486/33

### Commodore 1901

Supports Chroma/Luma and RGBi out of the box, and {% post_link Adding-an-RGB-SCART-connector-to-a-Commodore-1901-monitor 'modded with SCART connector' %}, so super-useful for most older computers!

### IBM 8504 Monochrome

Part of the IBM PS/2 model 30 package.

### BenQ BL702A

Not really a vintage monitor, since it was released in 2013. However, it supports 15 kHz horizontal refresh,
so it works with the VGA-signals from the Amigas and the Atari ST, so it's still very useful!
